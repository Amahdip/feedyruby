<a id="getting-started"></a>

## 🚀 Getting started

We've got several options depending on your need to help you quickly get started with FeedyRuby.

<a id="cloud-version"></a>

### ☁️ Cloud Version

FeedyRuby has a hosted cloud offering with a generous free plan to get you up and running as quickly as possible. To get started, please visit [feedyruby.com](https://app.feedyruby.com/auth/signup).

<a id="self-hosted-version"></a>

### 🐳 Self-hosting FeedyRuby

FeedyRuby is available Open-Source under AGPLv3 license. You can host FeedyRuby on your own servers using Docker without a subscription.

#### Docker

To get started with self-hosting with Docker, take a look at our [self-hosting docs](https://feedyruby.com/docs/self-hosting/deployment).

#### FeedyRuby production image (survey.feedyruby.ir)

This fork ships scripts for building and deploying a **custom** app image. Do not run the upstream Formbricks image in production if you need FeedyRuby branding, Farsi (fa-IR), or RTL fixes.

**Docker Hub:** [amirmpa/feedyruby](https://hub.docker.com/r/amirmpa/feedyruby)

| Step | Command |
|------|---------|
| Build (on Mac; avoids Docker OOM) | `./scripts/build-feedyruby-image-from-host.sh` |
| Push to Docker Hub | `docker login -u amirmpa` then `./scripts/push-feedyruby-image-dockerhub.sh` |
| Build + push | `PUSH_TO_DOCKERHUB=true ./scripts/build-feedyruby-image-from-host.sh` |
| Deploy on survey VPS | `sudo docker pull amirmpa/feedyruby:latest && sudo docker compose up -d feedyruby` |

Details, server paths, mirrors, and troubleshooting: see **Production Docker Image** in [AGENTS.md](./AGENTS.md).

**Live instance:** https://survey.feedyruby.ir — admin login uses the email/password from first-time setup (e.g. `amir@feedyruby.ir`).

**Survey server scripts:** `scripts/survey-server-bootstrap.sh` (first install), `scripts/survey-server-finish-deploy.sh` (pull image + start stack).

## 👩‍⚖️ License

### The AGPL FeedyRuby Core

The FeedyRuby core application is licensed under the [AGPLv3 Open Source License](https://github.com/feedyruby/feedyruby/blob/main/LICENSE). The core application is fully functional and includes everything you need to design & run link surveys, website surveys and in-app surveys. You can use the software for free for personal and commercial use. You're also allowed to create and distribute modified versions as long as you document the changes you make incl. date. The AGPL license requires you to publish your modified version under the AGPLv3 license as well.

### The Enterprise Edition

Additional to the AGPL licensed FeedyRuby core, this repository contains code licensed under an Enterprise license. The [code](https://github.com/feedyruby/feedyruby/tree/main/apps/web/modules/ee) and [license](https://github.com/feedyruby/feedyruby/blob/main/apps/web/modules/ee/LICENSE) for the enterprise functionality can be found in the `/apps/web/modules/ee` folder of this repository. This additional functionality is not part of the AGPLv3 licensed FeedyRuby core and is designed to meet the needs of larger teams and enterprises. This advanced functionality is already included in the Docker images, but you need an [Enterprise License Key](https://feedyruby.com/docs/self-hosting/enterprise) to unlock it.

### White-Labeling FeedyRuby and Other Licensing Needs

We currently do not offer FeedyRuby white-labeled. That means that we don't sell a license which let's other companies resell FeedyRuby to third parties under their name nor take parts (like the survey editor) out of FeedyRuby to add to their own software products. Any other needs? [Send us an email](mailto:hola@feedyruby.com).

### Why charge for Enterprise Features?

The Enterprise Edition allows us to fund the development of FeedyRuby sustainably. It guarantees that the free and open-source surveying infrastructure we're building will be around for decades to come.
